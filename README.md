# Gathering Beer Data and Making it Useful and Pretty! That's TappData.

Want to know what the most popular style of beer in Chicago is during the winter months? How about how beer tastes change as we age? Want to see beautiful D3 charts breaking down your personal consumption habits and preferences while simultaneously convincing you that science is cool? TappData is your app. 

## What Can it Do for You

TappData gives users of the app Untappd (a social media site that allows users to "check in" and rate each beer they drink), personalized data analytics and visualizations to help them better understand their beer tastes and discover new beers.

## What Ca it Do for the World (current work in progress)

Our app sifts through the data of over one million user check ins per month. Applying our custom algorithms, we are able to extract and display many interesting and insightful patterns. Some of these patterns include showing us the effect climate has on users' tastes, keywords that appear most in reviews of highly revered beers, and which breweries are viewed favorably. 

## Known Issues

* API call limit lower than needed for medium site traffic
* When API call limit is reached, app breaks due to empty D3 chart error
* Scaling issues with SVG/div components

## Built with...

* Ruby or Rails
* JavaScript
* D3
* Untappd API (thanks, Jen!)
* Blood, sweat & tears. The band, not the fluids
